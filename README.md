# burger

This application is designed to allow a user to add and modify persistent data in the (fun) form of burgers.

## Interface
The user can create a new burger at the bottom of the page, and assign an initial value to it of either 'devoured' or 'not eaten yet. Then, a user can click buttons to update a burger once it has been created, devouring it, making it again, or deleting it.
